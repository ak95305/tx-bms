                        CCPA, that we disclose to that resident:</p>

                        <li>the categories of personal information we have collected about them,</li>

                        <li>the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about them (collectively, a
                            "Request to Know").</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To make such a Request to Know, you can either call us at our toll free number (1-833-917-2099),

                        from the sources described in that section. We use and share this information with third parties
                        as described in the section entitled "USE OF COLLECTED INFORMATION" above.</p>
                    <p>TXBMS does not sell your personal information.</p>
                    <p><em>Right to request deletion of personal information</em></p>
                    <p>Each California resident has the right to request the deletion of their personal information that
                        we collect or maintain (a "Request to Delete"), subject to certain exceptions set forth in the
                        CCPA. To make such a Request to Delete, you can either call us at our toll free number

                    <p><em>Process for verifying requests of California residents</em></p>

                        to Delete that you may submit, we must verify your identity. We will verify your identity by
                        asking you to provide certain data that we have already collected from you to confirm that they
                        match our records. In certain instances, additional verification steps may be required.</p>
                    <p><em>Authorized agents</em></p>
                    <p>California residents have the right to designate an authorized agent to make a request under the
                        CCPA on their behalf. Prior to completing a request made by such an authorized agent, we require
                        that you provide your authorized agent with written permission to submit such a request and
                        require that you or your authorized agent provide us with a copy of such written permission.
                        Additionally, we require that you verify your identity pursuant to the procedure described
                        above.</p>

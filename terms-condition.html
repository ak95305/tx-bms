                        unauthorized disclosure by preventing others from using Your computer and/or password, and by
                        completely signing off and closing Your browser after accessing the Site.</p>

                        information is not necessarily an indication of future performance. See <a
                            href="#forward-looking">“Forward-Looking Statements”</a> below.</p>
                    <h2 id="forward-looking" data-offset="-100">FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS</h2>
                    <p>The Site may contain statements that constitute forward-looking statements as such term is
                        defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the
                        Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of
                        performance. They represent our intentions, plans, expectations and beliefs and are subject to
                        numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Our future results, financial condition and
                        business may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. You can
                        find many of these statements by looking for words such as “approximates,” “believes,”
                        “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “would,” “may” or other similar
                        expressions. We also note the following forward-looking statements: in the case of our
                        development and redevelopment projects, the estimated completion date, estimated project cost
                        and cost to complete; and estimates of future capital expenditures, dividends to common and
                        preferred shareholders and operating partnership distributions. Many of the factors that will
                        determine the outcome of these and our other forward-looking statements are beyond our ability
                        to control or predict. For further discussion of factors that could materially affect the
                        outcome of our forward-looking statements and our future results and financial condition, see
                        “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our most recent
                        Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.</p>
                    <p>Currently, one of the most significant factors is the ongoing adverse effect of the COVID-19
                        pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, operating
                        performance and the effect it has had and may continue to have on our tenants, the global,
                        national, regional and local economies and financial markets and the real estate market in
                        general. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on future developments,
                        including the duration of the pandemic, which are highly uncertain but that impact could be
                        material. Moreover, you are cautioned that the COVID-19 pandemic will heighten many of the risks
                        identified in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our
                        most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.</p>
                    <p>For these statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements
                        contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You are cautioned not to
                        place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date such
                        statements were made. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to
                        us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the
                        cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. We do not undertake any
                        obligation to release publicly any revisions to our forward-looking statements to reflect events
                        or circumstances occurring after the date of such forward-looking statements. You should,
                        however, review the factors and risks we describe in the reports we file from time to time with
                        the SEC.</p>
